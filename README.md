# tten_final

Welcome to my website where you can go to lookup whatever pokemon you want. This site will display information from their name to their stats.

To make this site I used a combination of vite and react to create to framework. Where I then implemented various frontend skills such as advanced html and css, javascript, event handling, and more.

Getting Started:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yournameforproject.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd yournameforproject

Install dependencies:
npm install

Start the project:
npm run dev

Deploy the project:
npm run deploy (npm run build should run right before it)

gh-pages: https://niickyds.github.io/tten_final/
